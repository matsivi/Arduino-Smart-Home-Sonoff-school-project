IoT Smart Lighting & Air Quality (SONOFF DIY & TTGO)
This is one of my school projects.

The system is based on the HTTP protocol, using a PIR sensor for motion detection and a Sonoff switch for remote control. It’s designed to be flexible, supporting additional sensors and functions depending on the project requirements.

The device communicates with ThingSpeak as the cloud service and also sends data over LoRa.

If you are interested in using this project locally—without the official Sonoff app—feel free to open an issue or comment. I’ll be happy to help you adapt it and provide the necessary presets and code changes.
